# Adafruit SSD1351 Color OLED library

Works with the [1.5 inch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1431), [1.27 inch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/684), and [0.96 inch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/684) OLED breakout boards.

This is extracted from https://github.com/mikeseeh/photon-demo-oled-sdcard and set up for the Spark Web IDE.

The library is based on https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1351-library but appears to have some significant differences.
