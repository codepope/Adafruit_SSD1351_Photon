# Adafruit SSD1351 Color OLED library

Confirmed working with the [1.5 inch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1431), and should also work with the [1.27 inch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/684), and [0.96 inch](https://www.adafruit.com/products/684) OLED breakout boards.

This is based on https://github.com/mikeseeh/photon-demo-oled-sdcard and https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-SSD1351-library and 99.9% of the credit goes to those authors.

## microSD Card is not currently supported

I fiddled with the code for a little while but couldn't convince it to work. 
Some folks apparently have, though: https://community.particle.io/t/particle-photon-oled-screen-and-sd-card-demo/18145
